# Basic-Car-Shworoom-Management-using-C
### I developed the basic car showroom management in C language using structure and queues. I am using Files for storage of customers, showroom and car details.
### Here are the steps:
### Step 1: Create file names with car1, car2, car3, car4, record and showroom. Record for customer names, Showroom for showroom names, car1 to car4 for car names present in showroom.
### Step 2: Add details in those files manually.
### Step 3: Run Car_Showroom.c
